???;Alright, that takes care of the bunch.;;FarmlandsHouse.jpg;;Music.mp3;
???;Are you alright, kid?;;;;;
Girl;Thank you so much, stranger.;NinaHappy.png;;;;
Girl;I went too far from town, but I really wanted those flower for big sis.;NinaHappy.png;;;;
Girl;If she was here, I'd she would take care of those slimes in seconds!;NinaHappy.png;;;;
???;Your big sis?;;;;;
;"As he wonders about the identity of this ""big sis"", he suddenly sees a ball of fire quickly approach his exact location.";;;;;
;In the nick of time, he dodges the fireball and secures his hairline.;;;;;
???;What in the blazes is going on???;;;;;
;A woman can be seen running towards the two of them, one still confused by the sudden attack.;;;;;
Woman;YOU BETTER GET AWAY FROM NINA!!!;AliceAngry.png;;;;
;As there seems to appear another flaming surprise from this hotheaded stranger, the little girl suddenly takes charge of the situation;;;;;
Girl;Big sis, it's alright, he saved me from the slimes.;NinaScared.png;;;;
;As the fire quickly disappears, the situation swiftly simmers down.;;;;;
Woman;Are you sure that's true, he didn't threaten you to say that?;AliceConfused.png;;;;
Girl;He really saved me, I was picking flowers when those scary slimes came to hurt me...;NinaScared.png;;;;
;The girl explains the situation, all the while he is looking dazzled at the two of them.;;;;;
;After a while...;;;;;
Woman;I'm sorry I tried to burn you a little..;AliceGrin.png;;;;
Woman;I heard my sister scream, so I thought you were the one causing problems.;AliceGrin.png;;;;
;(I think that fireball would inflict some more damage, but let's stay polite.);;;;;
;(After all, I still need some intel about this world.);;;;;
???;It's alright, I would probably do the same if my sister was in danger.;;;;;
;(Do I even have family? I don't remember.);;;;;
???;Anyway, mind telling me something about this place? I'm a bit lost right now.;;;;;
Girl;We are in the farmlands, really close to our village.;NinaHappy.png;;;;
Girl;I am Nina and I live together with my big sis Alice.;NinaHappy.png;;;;
???;Ah, is that so? Well, glad to make your acquaintance Nina and Alice.;;;;;
Nina;What's your name mister?;NinaWonder.png;;;;
???;Uhhh, I don't remember?;;;;;
Nina;You don't remember? That's so sad...;Ninasad.png;;;;
???;How about you give me one?;;;;;
;(It's not like I want to make one myself.);;;;;
;(I have no clue how this world works, but at the same time I don't feel like standing out too much.);;;;;
;(Imagine receiving some weird name that stands out in public, it would ruin everything.);;;;;
Nina;Hmmmmmm....;NinaWonder.png;;;;
Nina;Your outfit is pretty weird.;NinaWonder.png;;;;
;(That wasn't the question!!);;;;;
Nina;You look like the hero who saved the world in the past.;NinaWonder.png;;;;
Nina;What is he called again...?;NinaWonder.png;;;;
Alice;Ah, you mean the Hero-King Loki? The one who saved this continent from the monsters?;AliceConfused.png;;;;
Nina;Yes! That's him, Looki.;NinaHappy.png;;;;
???;Hmmm, Loki. I suppose it does have a certain ring to it.;;;;;
???;That settles it, I am Loki. ;;;;;
Nina;Nice to meet you, Looki;NinaHappy.png;;;;
;(... close enough.);;;;;
Alice;By the way, I noticed you were using some advanced magic. What school did you attend?;AliceConfused.png;;;;
;(This is considered advanced? Sheesh, the kids of today...);;;;;
Loki;School? Well I don't remember ever joining one. Mind telling me something about magic?;;;;;
Alice;That's pretty easy, magic is everything.;AliceNeutral.png;;;;
Alice;Everything is pretty much capable of using magic, but the usefulness depends per person;AliceNeutral.png;;;;
Alice;Some can set entire buildings aflame, some can barely burn a blade of grass.;AliceNeutral.png;;;;
Alice;Also, there are different kinds of elements.;AliceNeutral.png;;;;
Alice;Every person has an affinity for an element, some people are lucky and might even have two.;AliceNeutral.png;;;;
