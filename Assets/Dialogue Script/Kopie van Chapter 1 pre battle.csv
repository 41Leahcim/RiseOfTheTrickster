Alice;If you haven't gone to a school yet, you should probably go to the academy.;AliceNeutral.png;Farmlandshouse.jpg;;Music.mp3;
Alice;Who knows, maybe you could get even stronger magic.;AliceNeutral.png;;;;
Loki;(This academy sounds like an interesting place.);;;;;
Loki;(I might be able to make more use of my magic if I go there.);;;;;
Loki;Alright, I'll go to the academy.;;;;;
Loki;So how do I get to this academy?;;;;;
Alice;It's in the capital, how about I show you the way.;AliceNeutral.png;;;;
Alice;I was on break and today was coincidentally the day it ends.;AliceNeutral.png;;;;
Loki;(hmm...);;;;;
Loki;(I'm not fond of the idea, but perhaps she could also give information along the way.);;;;;
Loki;Yeah, that would be great.;;;;;
Alice;Let me say goodbye to Nina, then we can get going.;;;;;
;Alice gives Nina a big hug;;;;;
Alice;I have to go back to the academy now, I'll come see you as soon as I have my next break.;AliceSad.png;;;;
Nina;Before you go big sis, here.;;;;;
;Nina hands Alice the flower she picked;;;;;
Nina;I picked this flower for you as a souvenir.;NinaHappy.png;;;;
Alice;Thank you, I love it.;AliceGrin.png;;;;
;Alice gives Nina another hug;;;;;
Loki;(They're quite the loving family.);;;;;
Loki;(...);;;;;
Loki;(What is this strange regret I'm feeling.);;;;;
Loki;(Let's not think about this now. I'll need to get more information about the academy first.);;;;;
Loki;(I should ask Alice about it while we're on the way there.);;;;;
Alice;Alright, I'll have to get going now. I'll see you later.;;;;;
;Alice and Loki start going through the windy woods;;WindyWoods.jpg;;;
Loki;So Alice, Could you tell me more about the academy?;;;;;
Alice;Sure, what should I tell you about?;AliceConfused.png;;;;
Loki;I'd like to know more about the academy in general.;;;;;
Alice;The academy is a place where both commoners and nobles learn magic together.;AliceNeutral.png;;;;
Alice;Commoners and nobles are equal in the academy since they are all students.;AliceGrin.png;;;;
Alice;Well that's how it should be, but because nobles are typically born with more affinity for magic they get quite arrogant.;AliceSad.png;;;;
Alice;Even more so, because the more affinity you have for magic, the higher your status in society.;AliceSad.png;;;;
Loki;(I feel like this isn't the first time I've heard of nobles being very arrogant.);;;;;
Alice;But the academy is trying to get rid of the magic prejudice by researching magic and magic affinity.;AliceGrin.png;;;;
Alice;They are trying to close the gap in status to try and create an equal society.;AliceGrin.png;;;;
Loki;That sounds like a really nice goal to have.;;;;;
Loki;(Nobles and commoners becoming equal in status? It honestly sounds too good to be true.);;;;;
Loki;(I'll have to keep a close eye on the academy once I'm a student.);;;;;
Loki;(Maybe if I find out it was too good to be true, I could make use of that information somehow.);;;;;
Alice;Huh, what's that sound?;AliceConfused.png;;;;
;Wolves come out of the bushes;;;WolfGrowl.mp3;;
Loki;(Great... We're being surrounded by wolves in the middle of a forest.);;;;;
Loki;Guess we have to fight our way out of this one.;;;;;
