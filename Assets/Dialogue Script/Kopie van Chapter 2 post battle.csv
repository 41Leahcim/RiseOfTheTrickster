Academy instructor;Alright, the exam has finished, everyone gather up.;Instructorneutral.png;Snowyard.jpg;;Music.mp3;
;Loki looks around as all the examinees gather up next to the instructor;;;;;
Loki;(Looks like a lot of people got injured, some more heavily than others.);;;;;
Academy instructor;It seems everyone is here so I will start telling everyone the results.;InstructorSmug.png;;;;
;The instructor proceeds to fail a lot of people and pass a few;;;;;
Academy instructor;Loki, you pass.;InstructorAngry.png;;;;
Loki;Loki, you pass.;;;;;
Loki;(Well I solo'd that weird ice guy, they had no choice but to let me pass anyway.);;;;;
;As everyone has gotten their exam result back, everyone starts to head back to the capital;;;;;
;As Loki starts moving back to the academy he notices a girl angrily storming towards the instructor;;;;;
???;Why are all the commoners having their exam in the haunted hills while the nobles are having theirs in the academy.;FayeAngry.png;;;;
???;Everyone was supposed to have their exam in the academy like always.;FayeAngry.png;;;;
Academy instructor;Calm down, there were some last minute changes and it simply happened to be that the commoners were the only ones affected.;InstructorNeutral.png;;;;
Academy instructor;If you have problem with this you should go to someone higher up, I can't help with it further than this.;InstructorNeutral.png;;;;
;The instructor walks away while the girl is still angrily yelling;;;;;
;The girl turns around and notices Loki and walks towards him;;;;;
???;I'm sorry you had to see that.;FayeSad.png;;;;
Loki;No worries, can I ask what happened?;;;;;
Loki;(I ask that, but it was pretty clear to hear that she was yelling at the top of her lungs.);;;;;
???;Well, it seems that some nobles have bribed some instructors to have the commoners undergo a harder and more dangerous exam.;FayeNeutral.png;;;;
Loki;Why would they do that?;;;;;
???;Well, as much as I don't like to admit it. Nobles don't like commoners.;FayeSad.png;;;;
???;Now that I think about it, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Faye Juliana Hurricane.;FayeSmile.png;;;;
Loki;Since you have a last name doesn't that mean that you're a noble as well?;;;;;
Faye;Yes, but I don't like the current nobles's discrimination against commoners.;FayeSad.png;;;;
Faye;I like it even less that it happens in the academy where everyone is supposed to be equal.;FayeSad.png;;;;
Loki;Wouldn't you normally take their side since you're one of them?;;;;;
Faye;I get your point, but as I said I don't like this discrimination.;FayeNeutral.png;;;;
Faye;In all honesty I even despise the hierarchy of the social system and want to get rid of it.;FayeNeutral.png;;;;
Loki;(I wonder if this is how she actually feels, or maybe just a facade to get information on the commoners.);;;;;
Loki;(I find it hard to believe that a noble would think like this, but we'll play along for now and see.);;;;;
Faye;Ah, it seems I have taken quite a bit of your time, we should quickly head back so your enrollment can be finalized.;FayeNeutral.png;;;;
Loki;Sure.;;;;;
;As Loki wants to move he is stopped in his tracks as he is blinded by a flashing light that appears before him;;;;;
;Once Loki is able to see again he sees a lantern appear before him;;TheLamp.png;;;
Loki;A lantern? Where did it come from?;;;;;
Loki;I better put it away for now, I'll look at it later.;;;;;
;Loki finally starts his way back to the academy;;;;;
