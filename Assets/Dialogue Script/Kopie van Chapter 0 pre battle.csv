;Chapter 0: The End.;;blackbackground.png;;;
???;Such a tragedy...;;BurningBackground.png;;Burning.mp3;
???;This story begins at the end of another one.;;;;;
???;Looking back, he probably didn't forsee this result.;;;;;
???;Oh well, no use fretting about it now.;;;;;
???;The destruction of a world might sound bad, but it's manageable.;;;;;
???;In the grand scheme of things, this is merely a slight setback.;;;;;
???;If only he'd know what is coming next...;;;;;
???;I could only imagine what his face would be like.;;;;;
???;But it's not like he will remember the past anyway.;;;;;
???;That right is reserved to another special individual...;;;;;
???;The best of luck to you, scheming one.;;;;;
???;Create a new beginning...;;;;;
???;or stagnate at your end.;;blackbackground.png;;;

;He slowly rises and looks around.;;Grass.jpg;;Ambiance.mp3;
;(Weird, I do not remember ever coming to this place.);;;;;
;(Yet I can't remember where I am coming from either.);;;;;
;(Well, it's not like standing here is going to answer either of those questions.);;;;;
;(I should inspect the environment some more.);;;;;
;(Perhaps I can find someone who might tell me something about this world.);;;;;
;Suddenly, a scream can be heard from afar.;;;ScreamLowered.mp3;;
       ;(That sounded like a person, perchance in need of help.);;;;;
;(A great opportunity to gain some intel.);;;;;
;As he was almost ready to depart, his foot knocked against something.;;;;;
;Looking down, he saw a strange book laying on the ground.;;;;;
                 ;(For some reason this feels familiar, might be handy to take it with me.);;;;;
;As he hurries to the source of the sound, he is met with a child.;;FarmlandsHouse.jpg;Running.mp3;;
;Unfortunately, she is surrounded by a group of small, round slime creatures.;;;;;
;(No clue what those things are, but destroying them would probably benefit me.);;;;;
;(What would be the best way to approach this situation, I wonder...?);;;;;
;(If only I had something to vanquish them with...);;;;;
;As he utters these words in his mind, the book he carried violently opens and the empty pages whirl from side to side.;;;;;
???;Ah, have you finally awakened?;;;;;
???;If it's power that you seek, I shall grant you my assistance.;;;;;
;As these words sounded clearly inside his head, the book suddenly halted the whirlwind of pages.;;;BookOpen.mp3;;
;Three entries appeared within the book: Fire, Ice and Water.;;;;;
;(Sounds like this book might be of greater use than expected.);;;;;
;(Alright, let us begin.);;;;;
