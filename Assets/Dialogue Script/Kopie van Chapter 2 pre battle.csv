Alice;We're almost there, look you can see the capital already!;AliceNeutral.png;CapitalOutside.jpg;;Music.mp3;
;They get closer to the city and get inspected by the guards;;;;;
;Inspection goes well and they get through the gates into the city;;;;;
Loki;(Huh, guess they'll let anyone into the capital.);;CapitalInside.jpg;;;
Alice;Welcome to the capital of albarest.;AliceGrin.png;;;;
Loki;I can see why they call it a capital, it's quite big.;;;;;
Loki;Where would the academy even be?;;;;;
Alice;It should be in that direction, follow me.;AliceNeutral.png;;;;
;They move towards the academy;;;Footsteps.mp3;;
Alice;Before you can attend the academy you'll have to take the enrollment exam.;AliceNeutral.png;AcademyOutside.jpg;;;
Loki;What kind of exam will it be?;;;;;
Alice;I don't know they change the content of the exam every year.;AliceSad.png;;;;
Loki;That sounds like a bothersome thing to do.;;;;;
Alice;You should be able to enroll into the exam over there.;AliceNeutral.png;;;;
;Loki enrolls into the exam;;;;;
Academy instructor;You're now enrolled, you will be part of group 2 for the exam.;InstructorNeutral.png;;;;
Loki;Do you know what the exam will be about?;;;;;
Academy instructor;I do know but I can't tell you.;InstructorNeutral.png;;;;
Loki;Why can't you tell me?;;;;;
Academy instructor;Because I can't tell you until it starts.;InstructorNeutral.png;;;;
Loki;Can't you give me a little bit of information.;;;;;
Academy instructor;If you'll stop annoying me after.;InstructorAngry.png;;;;
Loki;As long as you give me something.;;;;;

;Loki looks around to look at the other examinees;;;;;
Loki;(I don't see any people with fancy or high-quality clothing, these must all be commoners.);;;;;
Loki;(That's weird I thought the academy stood for equality between commoners and nobles.);;;;;
Academy instructor;For the exam you guys will have to kill monsters within the graveyard.;InstructorNeutral.png;;;;
Academy instructor;While doing so you will be graded by the examiners;;;;;
;The other examinees are looking down;;;;;
Loki;(This smells of corruption, there is no way that examinees are able to use magic well enough.);;;;;
Loki;(Apart from me ofcourse.);;;;;
;Loki notices four large obelisks standing menacingly within the graveyard;;;;;
Loki;(Killing enemies seems easy enough, maybe I could also look into those pillars...);;;;;
