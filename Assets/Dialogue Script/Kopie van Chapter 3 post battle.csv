Loki;(Phew...);;BurningCity.png;;Music.mp3;
Loki;(It was a long battle but we defended the capital, or whats left of the capital anyway.);;;;;
Faye;Hey, Loki you alright?;FayeSad.png;;;;
Loki;Yeah I'm fine, can't say the same for the city though.;;;;;
Faye;I think this happened a long time ago as well, monsters attacking the capital in huge waves.;FayeNeutral.png;;;;
Faye;At that time there was a demon king in the north. He was residing in the facinorous forest if I remember correctly.;FayeNeutral.png;;;;
Faye;The demon king was slain by the hero-king Loki.;FayeHappy.png;;;;
Loki;You think that there might be another demon king in the north?;;;;;
Faye;Could be possible, the situation is the same as 300 years ago.;FayeNeutral.png;;;;
Loki;(A demon king, I wonder what kind of person he'd be.);;;;;
Loki;I think I might head up north and have a look if this demon king person has actually returned.;;;;;
Loki;(If he actually exists and I defeat him I would become a hero.);;;;;
Loki;(Imagine the power I would have then.);;;;;
Faye;It would be a dangerous journey. Many that set foot into the facinorous forest have not returned, so I don't recommend it.;FayeSad.png;;;;
Loki;Even so, I think I will still go. I'll figure out things once I get near the forest. ;;;;;
Faye;Doesn't sound like I could stop you even if I tried.;FayeNeutral.png;;;;
Faye;Well, I will at least wish you luck on your journey.;FayeHappy.png;;;;
Loki;Thanks. See you later.;;;;;
;Loki heads out of the capital and gets on his way to the north;;;;;
;(To be continued...);;;;;
